### Project Overview
Given the plethora of film studios and streaming services, our team analysed recent trends to discover ways for Microsoft to stand out amongst its competitors when first entering the film industry. We used Microsoft's values to guide our investigation, honing in on the company's focus on Diversity and Inclusion and its "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives". We analyzed the awards and financial successes of international films, the diversity of the top-grossing actors worldwide over the last decade, and the return of investment for marginalized stories.  

### Data 
1. The Numbers - detailed database where film and numbers meet 
2. Ethnicelebs - find out the nationality, background, ancestry or race of famous celebrities
3. They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? - growing film resource dedicated to the art of motion picture filmmaking 
4. IMDb - the world's most popular and authoriative source for movie, TV and celebrity content
5. Box Office Mojo - website that tracks box office revenue 

### Methodology 
In our research for this project, we focused on what it could mean for Microsoft to start a film studio that values "Diversity and Inclusion." We gathered data on international films, top-grossing actors, and films tagged with key words that could highlight marginalized stories, to analyze its financial and reputational rewards.

### Results

<b>Diversity in Top-Grossing Films</b>
<br><i>Found in TopGrossingFilms_Diversity.ipynb</i>
<br><br>In previous years, film studios recieved criticism regarding the lack of diversity of its cast. Movements like #OscarsSoWhite in 2015 and #whitewashedOUT in 2016 demanded for more representation in Hollywood. This notebook seeks to find whether the Box Office has responded to those demands by analyzing the 100 top grossing actors for 2010-2020. Does the world want to watch more films featuring people of color? If so, what roles are they casted for- do they play the lead star or the supportive best friend with 20 minutes of screen time? 

To answer this, we found data from the-numbers.com, which provided the 100 top grossing actors for each year, along with their star score and average billing. A star score is given to actors based on the number of top-grossing films they are featured in, while the average billing signifies their ranking of importance in a film. For each actor on that list, we found their ethnicity by scraping data through ethnicelebs.com, then categorized their ethnicity into racial categories defined by the Census Bureau. We found that star scores have gone up by 98, 63.5, and 377.5 points for Black, Native American/Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander actors consecutively, meaning more top grossing films feature people of color!

We also find that although there are more actors of color in the Top Grossing actors list, actors of color carry a higher billing average, which means they play less important roles in those films. In 2010, there were only 9 actors of color in the top 100, then in 2020, that number increased to 34 actors of color. However, average billing has gone down significantly, especially for Native American/Aslaskan Native actors. Native American/Alaskan Native actors had an average billing of 3.6 in 2010, but 10 years later, went by 21.4 to an average billing of 24.

<b>Return of Investment for Marginalized Stories</b> ... 

### Recommendation 
<br> Microsoft can take the lead in creating films that not only feature people of color, but cast them in lead roles. Microsoft's values share the "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives," and showcasing the stories of people of color is one great way to do that.
