# Film Analysis 

### Project Overview
Given the plethora of film studios and streaming services, our team analysed recent trends to discover ways to allow for Microsoft to stand out amongst its competitors when first entering the film industry. We used Microsoft's values to guide our investigation, honing in on the company's focus on Diversity and Inclusion and its "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives". Breaking that down, we analyzed the number of awards and financial success of international films, the diversity of the top-grossing actors over the last decade, and the return of investment for different types of stories. 

### Data 
1. The Numbers - provides a detailed database on the top-grossing actors along with their billing average. 
2. Ethnicelebs - provides ethnicity information for famous celebrities.
