# Phase1_Project

Introduction
For this project, my team and I were tasked with providing business recommendations for Microsoft, a well-resourced company looking to join the film industry. Given the plethora of film studios and streaming services, we thought about what would make Microsoft stand out amongst its competitors. We also wanted to use Microsoft's key values to guide our investigation. Upon initial research, our team decided to hone in on Microsoft's focus on Diversity and Inclusion and its "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives". Our team branched out into different sectors of Diversity and Inclusion- looking at the successes of international films, movies featuring people of color, and the themes of different stories.

This notebook in particular provides the research on the last decade's top grossing films and the actors and actresses featured in them. When looking at the data, I asked myself the following questions:

Does a film do better in the box office if it features people of color?
Are there more people of color in films now than before?
If so, are they casted for lead roles or do they play supporting characters?
Scraping the Data
For my research, I scraped data from the-numbers.com to find the top-grossing actors from the last decade. Next, I scraped data from ethnicelebs.com to find each celebrity's ethnicity. For the sake of the project, I categorized ethnicities into racial categories defined by census.org.
