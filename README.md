### Project Overview
Given the plethora of film studios and streaming services, our team analysed recent trends to discover ways for Microsoft to stand out amongst its competitors when first entering the film industry. We used Microsoft's values to guide our investigation, honing in on the company's focus on Diversity and Inclusion and its "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives". We analyzed the awards and financial successes of international films, the diversity of the top-grossing actors worldwide over the last decade, and the return of investment for marginalized stories.  

### Data 
1. The Numbers - detailed database where film and numbers meet 
2. Ethnicelebs - find out the nationality, background, ancestry or race of famous celebrities
3. They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? - growing film resource dedicated to the art of motion picture filmmaking 
4. IMDb - the world's most popular and authoriative source for movie, TV and celebrity content
5. Box Office Mojo - website that tracks box office revenue 

### Methodology 
In our research for this project, we focused on what it could mean for Microsoft to start a film studio that values "Diversity and Inclusion." We gathered data on international films, top-grossing actors, and films tagged with key words that could highlight marginalized stories, to analyze its financial and reputational rewards.

### Results 
<b>Box Office for International Films</b> ... 

<b>Awards for International Films</b> ... 

<b>Diversity in Top-Grossing Films</b>... 
<br>We looked into star scores, a score given to actors based on the number of top-grossing films they are featured in, for actors in the Top 100 Grossing Actors over the last 10 years. For each actor on that list, we found their ethnicity through ethnicelebs, then categorized their ethnicity into racial categories based on the definitions of the Census Bureau. We were curious to see if the Box Office's top grossing films featured more people of color. What we found was that star scores have gone up significantly for Black, Native American/Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander actors, meaning more top grossing films feature people of color.

We also find that although there are more people of color in the Top Grossing actors list, they have a higher billing average, which means that they have less important roles in those films.

<b>Return of Investment for Marginalized Stories</b> ... 

### Recommendation 
<br> Microsoft can take the lead in creating films that not only feature people of color, but cast them in lead roles. Microsoft's values share the "transformative power of engaging many different perspectives," and showcasing the stories of people of color is one great way to do that.
